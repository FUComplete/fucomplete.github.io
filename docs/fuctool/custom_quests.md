{: .text-yellow-300 .fw-500 .text-center .fs-8 .lh-default .no_toc }

{: .warning }
Just as a precaution, **ALWAYS** backup your save before injecting quests just in case something goes wrong.

In the folder where you extracted the zip from [Step 1](/docs/setup.html/#step-1-download-latest-build-of-fucomplete), copy your custom quests to the `quests` folder. 

Open `FUCTool` and go to the `Custom Quests` tab, you should see your quests listed in the left table.

{: .note }
If you do not see your quests listed in the left table, please make sure your quests are **decryted** and either `.mib` or `.pat`. 

Press the `Select` button and select your save folder, it will be in `SAVEDATA` and will be one of the following IDs

* `ULUS10391`
* `ULES01213`
* `ULJM05500`
{: .pl-6 }

Once you select your save folder you can now begin to backup/inject quests.

* **To backup quests**: Click on each quest you wish to backup and press the `<---` button.
* **To inject quests**: Click on each quest you wish to inject and press the `--->` button.
{: .pl-6 }

Once you are happy, hit the `Save` button to inject the quests.

{: .warning }
Please **DO NOT** try to resave while you have the game running, this will corrupt your save. **ALWAYS** have the game closed and reload your save when you inject quests.
